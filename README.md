# Stress-Strain
Stress strain analysis of wood under compression 


This code analyzes stress-strain data from test done parallel to the grain and returns young's modulus, maximum stress, strain at maximum stress, ultimate strain, and the ratio of ultimate strain to strain at maximum stress.

To see the outpu, just open the [UltimateStrain_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/RubenJC-1/Stress-Strain/blob/main/UltimateStrain_analysis.ipynb) file.
